# hello-world
first thing that i have done!!!

My name is Robert Coates as some already know. I'm a 61 year old male. I'm married. in an unusual way. You could say we are seperated but live together. It's more like a roommate situation than a marriage.
We have one son who is 26 years old that still lives at home most of the time.
We are from a parish which is adjacent to New Orleans. It is called Metairie. As you can tell this is located in Louisiana.
I presently am attending Colorado Technical University pursuing a BSIT degree. My wife is a Registered Nurse doing home health care. My son has aspirations of becoming a Chef someday.
Now you know a little about myself and my family.
